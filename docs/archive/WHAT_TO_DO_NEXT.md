## 💡 MY RECOMMENDATION:

**Complete Phase 4 first** (1.5 hours), then add Auth (1.5 hours).

**Why?**
1. Route saving is critical for the system
2. Visual indicators make it beautiful
3. Auth can be added last
4. You'll have complete routing before securing it

**Total time to MVP**: 3 hours from now
